The last couple of weeks have been interesting for developers who have reason to care what Microsoft are doing. Microsoft.Data, Lightswitch, and the effective withdrawal of resources from IronRuby have sent discouraging messages to much of the community.

On their own, each of these would probably not merit much attention, but in close succession you can't help but start to feel there's a direction. That direction seems, in part, to say "you don't need developers to build business systems".

However, I think that the following quote from Bob Martin is a bit closer to the truth: <em>"It seems to me that many problems in software development stem from the desire to decouple software development from programmers"</em>. (source: Twitter - http://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/20972119992)

The aim seems laudable, democratising software, opening it up. Business people don't have time to write software. Sriram Krishnan wrote in his post "Lisp is Sin" that <em>"When you look at technology like Windows Workflow Foundation, one of the driving forces was to let non-geeks build software"</em>. The underlying idea behind things is that software is one of those areas where professionalism can be added on afterwards. We can let the business users get the system pretty much working, then if you need a developer, get them to fix it up.

Microsoft called the "lowest" category of software developer Mort. I don't want to be elitist about programming. It should be open to all to learn. But when it comes to building systems which people are going to pay money for, which are supposed to have business value, let's try and get skilled people to build them.

Or I have an alternative. I'm going to be a Mort doctor. Because after all, business people don't have time to learn all kinds of details they'll never need. They just need to sort out this cough that won't go away. Years in med school is a bit pointless just to fix up one system that's only ever going to be used by one person! If it needs a bit more work, I'll give a doctor a call later on.
