Flipboard ( <a href="http://www.flipboard.com">flipboard.com</a> ) is a new iPad app/service which takes your social content (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and turns it in to a magazine style experience for the iPad. Contemporary layout, seamless consistent branding, and a strong style guide seem to be in place.

What's interesting about this is that I think it's the first time I've seen a real genuine proposition for what you might term the "curated web" or "re-experienced web". At least, it is in a way. Essentially this is taking the web, with all of the warts and non-standard design, and packaging it in a way that everyone can get quickly and enjoyably. Which in a bizarre way reminds me of AOL.

Of course, this is more beautiful (judging by the screenshots, I've not been able to try it out yet), but once again we're seeing people creating value by thinking about experience first. I hope it's successful.
