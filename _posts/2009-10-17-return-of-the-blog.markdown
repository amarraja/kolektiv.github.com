Like everything worth doing, this starts with an apology. The blog that has previously been sitting here, unloved, un-cared for and lonely for so long has gone. I'm not apologising for it going, but that it took so long. I'd broken bits of server which weren't supposed to be tampered with, and while I knew they were fixable, there never seemed to be time to sit down and do it. Time passed, I decided I didn't much like the old blog anyway, so I just decided to ditch the damn thing and replace it with something much simpler.

I'll be writing a quick post about that simpler solution soon because I think it's interesting in itself, plus I feel the need to have a massive rant about the quality of alternatives out there. Yes WordPress, I mean you.

I actually have a notebook full of draft articles which I'll be gently nudging on to this site in good time, but it's going to have to be ranting first before we get to the sensible stuff. Sorry. Good to end with an apology as well I think, no?
