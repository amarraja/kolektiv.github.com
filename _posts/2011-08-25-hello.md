There's not a lot to say in first posts on blogs, and I certainly can't think of anything. All I really want to indicate is that I'll be blogging on mainly software development and tech related things. A lot of them will probably be .NET because that's work related, but I'm sure I'll be writing about some of the other things I enjoy fiddling with as well (Ruby, Erlang, Io, Haskell, compilers, distributed things, you name it). 

Anyway, enough waffle &mdash; time to start writing real content.
