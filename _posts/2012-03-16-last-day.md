After nearly six years of working for Snow Valley (now [Micros Ecommerce Services][Micros]), today is my last day. I won't go in to why I've decided that now is a good time to move on, perhaps one day in the future it'll be apparent in some more abstract posts. I have had a fantastic time there though and learnt a lot, as well as met some very smart people who remain good friends. 

However I'm very happy to say that I've found a challenge which really (I hope!) suits me, as CTO of [ArtSpotter][]. It's a complete change of pace and culture, and a complete change of technology - from a primarily Microsoft-centric organisation to one based around open source and relatively bleeding edge technology. I'll definitely be blogging more about how we build out and manage our stack, both here and over at the ArtSpotter development blog (when that's up and running at some point in the future - it isn't currently the top of my priority list :)

Enough for now &mdash; I'm off to get started on the next six years.
