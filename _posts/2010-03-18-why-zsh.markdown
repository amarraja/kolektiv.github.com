Loads of people are finding themselves in text shells these days who may not historically have been inclined to try them. There's a couple of reasons for this, the main ones being Git and Mercurial. While there are GUI tools available, they're just not as nice generally speaking as the command line usage, which is really well designed in both cases.

Even on Windows, people are finding themselves in Bash a lot as they're now using Git - Rob Conery and others are helping to bring this to Windows developers through good training like <a href="http://www.tekpub.com/preview/git">Tekpub: Mastering Git</a>.

But Bash isn't that great, so this is a suggestion if you're getting started out with Git and finding yourself in a shell a lot. Try ZSH.

To give an idea why, here's a screenshot of my ZSH shell on Windows (I'm running ZSH under cygwin, which can also not be recommended highly enough).

In the prompt I've got plenty of useful information. If you look at the earlier prompts you can see the "!" and "+" symbols, showing that I've got modified (and then added) files. I can see which branch I'm on. I can see the ID of the last commit. I could do more, but this seems a nice balance. 

Not only do I now avoid "git status" most of the time, but I have great completion - for Git and other things. 

Give ZSH a try. It'll speed you up no end and look good doing it. For reference, my ZSH setup is at <a href="http://github.com/kolektiv/my_zsh">Github</a>. It's nothing special, bits and pieces cobbled together from other people. But it might help you get started.
