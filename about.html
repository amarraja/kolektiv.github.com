<p>Third person is a bit vain here, I won't bother. I'm a software guy working in Brighton and London, currently as CTO with <a href="http://www.artspotter.com" title="Visit the ArtSpotter site">these folk</a> (see disclaimer in footer!) I love software, languages, and try to add new ones to my list on a nearly continuous basis.</p>

<p>Happily I don't just code, I'm in to most of the normal things - music, films, drinking, more music, living by the seaside. Anyway &mdash; if you want to get in touch there's plenty of ways of doing so and they're all linked somewhere on this site.</p>
